      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I am a 4th-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation. My academic background focuses on networking and IT support, where I have gained foundational knowledge in network configuration, troubleshooting, and system basics through coursework and simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer.

I have also created and deployed a static website using Netlify, which helped me understand basic website deployment, HTTPS, and how systems are accessed over the internet. In addition, I have experience creating simple Excel-based systems to improve office tasks.

I am eager to learn, willing to be trained, and looking for an internship opportunity where I can gain hands-on experience, support IT operations, and continue developing my technical skills.
