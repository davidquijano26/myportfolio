# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website developed as part of my academic and professional preparation as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student, with a focus on networking and IT support.

The portfolio showcases my basic technical skills, online certifications, and a deployed web project that demonstrates foundational experience in system deployment and cloud-based hosting.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- GitHub (Version Control)
